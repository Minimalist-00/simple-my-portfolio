I'm someone who has confronted my self-indulgent nature head-on and committed to transforming myself with unwavering determination.

Throughout middle and high school, I was lazy—avoiding what I wanted or needed to do, endlessly gaming and scrolling through short videos instead. I spent 5,000 hours playing Splatoon. "I want to work hard, but I can't." Even when I'd psych myself up to try, the motivation would fizzle out almost immediately. I knew what I was doing, but I couldn't stop. I genuinely hated myself for it.

By June of my fourth year of university, nothing had changed. I'd accepted a job offer and was set to start working, but a fierce sense of crisis hit me: "If I enter society like this, I'm finished." I'd been running away, blaming my circumstances instead of facing reality. But I decided, "No more running," and chose to go to graduate school.

To change myself, I needed to understand why I couldn't push through. After thinking it over, I realized there was a huge gap between my "ideal" and "reality." My ideal was a life where I constantly brought my passions to life. But my reality was one where I could do neither what I should do nor what I wanted to do—just wasting away, hating myself day after day.

So I tried everything, no matter how unglamorous. I visualized my days on a calendar to see where time was being wasted. I journaled my feelings and realizations daily, trying to talk myself out of running away. After about six months, nothing had changed. But even when it was painful to see no results, I kept at it—trial and error, applying the PDCA cycle, testing new strategies. I read books on self-management despite hating reading, and there were nights I spent five hours in tears reflecting on myself.

After about a year and roughly 200 different strategies, I finally graduated from about 70% of my self-indulgent habits. This journey of self-transformation led to an opportunity to speak at the Future Life Village at the Osaka-Kansai Expo in July 2025, where I shared "a modern young person's way of living" with others in my generation who were struggling.

What I learned through all of this is that real progress only begins when you accept that the version of yourself who falls back into old habits is still _you_. And that the cycle of taking small steps—trying something → reflecting on how it went → applying what you learned—is essential not just in this process, but throughout life.

This is how I established my guiding principle: **"Growing by turning my weaknesses into strengths."**
