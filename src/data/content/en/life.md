I am someone who has faced my lazy self head-on and worked on self-reform with a strong will to absolutely change.

Since junior high and high school, I was a lazy person who didn't face what I wanted to do or should do, just playing games and watching short videos. I played a game called Splatoon for 5000 hours, thinking "I want to try hard but I can't." Even when I got motivated to work hard, that enthusiasm would quickly fade. I knew it, but I couldn't stop. I really hated myself for that.

The situation hadn't changed even in June of my fourth year of university. I had accepted a job offer and was planning to start working, but I felt a fierce sense of crisis that "if I go into society like this, it's over." I had been running away, not facing my real self and saying it was because the environment was bad, but I decided "let's stop running away from life" and resolved to go to graduate school.

To change myself, I needed to know the reality of why I couldn't work hard. After thinking about it, I realized there was a big gap between my "ideal and reality." My ideal was a state where I was embodying my "I want to do this!" one after another. But the reality was that I couldn't do both what I should do and what I wanted to do, living a lazy life and hating myself for it every day.

So I tried various things in a down-to-earth way. I visualized with a calendar and made wasted time visible. I wrote down my daily feelings and realizations, reminding myself who runs away immediately. I tried for about half a year, but I couldn't change at all. However, even though it was hard not getting results, I repeated trial and error, kept trying new strategies with a PDCA cycle in mind. I wasn't good at reading, but I read books on self-management, and sometimes cried and reflected for 5 hours in the middle of the night.

After about a year and implementing about 200 countermeasures, I finally graduated from about 70% of my lazy self. This experience of self-reform led to an opportunity to speak at the Future Life Village at the Osaka-Kansai Expo in July 2025 under the theme of "Communicating Modern Youth Lifestyles" to troubled young people of the same generation.

What I learned through this series of experiences is that I can only move to the next step after accepting that the self who easily falls into laziness and can't work hard is also me. And I realize that the cycle of trying small steps → reflecting on how it went → applying it to the next is important in everything and will definitely be useful in my life afterwards.

Thus, I established the principle of "**growing by using my weaknesses as nourishment**."
