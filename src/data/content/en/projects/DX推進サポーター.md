## FY2023: Individual Problem-Solving Approach

- Directly intervened in each department, handling everything from interviews to proposing improved business flows and implementing/introducing systems
- Promoted business improvement using tools such as Cybozu's "kintone" and "FormBridge" and Microsoft's "Power Automate"
- **Case Study:** In the Public Relations Division, through interviews and meetings with prefectural government employees, automated the sorting of vast amounts of public relations items and media, and introduced the system

**Reflections and Learnings**

- Improving one task was just the tip of the iceberg and did not lead to "organization-wide DX" or "proactive motivation of employees"
- Systems also deteriorate in about 3 years when personnel who can maintain and operate them are transferred

## FY2024: Organization-wide DX Promotion, Supporting Motivated Employees

- To promote the spread of MS365, disseminated DX-related information in an easy-to-understand manner as "Quick Tips" on technical blogs and Teams channels specialized for the prefectural government
- For employees with business challenges, provided "support" in the form of extracting essential issues from interviews → proposing improvement plans and methods (respecting employee autonomy)
- Worked with SoftBank to serve as a mentor in a DX promotion leader training workshop

**Reflections and Learnings**

- DX-related information was scattered across multiple platforms, resulting in a situation where it was "not seen/not known/not used"
- Generative AI was introduced in FY2024 but is hardly being utilized
- Many employees feel challenged by document search and management (a relatively common issue across all departments and tasks)

## FY2025: Information Integration and Generative AI Utilization

**Main Initiatives**

- Integration of scattered information → Implementation of an in-house search system using generative AI
- Further expanding connections with prefectural government employees to strengthen the foundation for DX promotion

**Automation of Vote Count Aggregation for House of Councillors Election**

- **Overview:** Shifted the reporting of voting results from each municipality to the Election Management Committee from email/phone → Forms/Power Automate
- **Before:** Email/phone → Prefectural Election Management Committee inputs into Excel → Formats according to template → Shares with media
- **After:** Submit via Forms → Power Automate automatically processes Excel → Media views results automatically posted to Box

## My Areas of Activity

- As a leader, focusing on "achieving results as an organization" and "developing members"
- Overall management including understanding the situation of members and each team
- Head of the generative AI utilization team
