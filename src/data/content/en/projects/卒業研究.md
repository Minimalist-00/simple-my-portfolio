"Verification of the Effect of Gradual Self-Disclosure through Music Preference Sharing on Acceptance"

## Content

Inspired by my own communication experiences, I tackled the social issue of "deepening interpersonal relationships" among young people in modern Japan. In this research, I developed a system that promotes gradual self-disclosure using music as a common topic for young people who find deep self-disclosure difficult. Through experiments, I empirically demonstrated that this approach is effective in promoting deep self-disclosure and in having the other party accept that content.
