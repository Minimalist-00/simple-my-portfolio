Web application development on the theme of public services in a 3-person team. In addition to task management and document organization using Notion, I took the initiative to introduce Git/GitHub for code management.

## Description

When we were in elementary school, I think there were people around us who had school notices stuffed in their backpacks or drawers. This app was created with the idea of "improving such a situation."

In the first place, there is also the problem that school notices are not `paperless`.

This app is a **tool for schools to communicate (notify) with parents**.
Teachers can post to "Class Announcements."
