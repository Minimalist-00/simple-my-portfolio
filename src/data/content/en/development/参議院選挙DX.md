## Overview

In the House of Councillors election held in July 2025, I implemented a system to replace the manual aggregation of periodic voting result reports from each municipality to the Election Management Committee, which had been done via email, phone, and manual tabulation, with Forms and Power Automate. It was actually used during the 2025 House of Councillors election and was very well received.

Before: Email/phone → Prefectural Election Management Committee inputs into Excel → Formats according to template → Shares with media

After: Submit via Forms → PA automatically processes Excel → Media views results automatically posted to Box

Period: July 2025 (approximately 3 weeks)

Format: Team (3 people)
