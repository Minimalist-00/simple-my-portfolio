## Overview

A project created at the Kyushu Hackathon that I participated in on impulse. A Chrome extension where Zundamon dubs overseas YouTube videos in real-time. I struggled because the voice generation couldn't keep up with the video and due to the constraints of developing a Chrome extension.
I won second place at my first Geek CAMP, and then competed in Geek CAMP Advance with updates such as adding emotion analysis features, and won (in a competition where award winners and above gathered).

June 2023 - September 2023

Role: Frontend (Chrome extension design and UI implementation with React)

## Key Points

- First Chrome extension development
  - The approach was completely different from React, so I learned how to write from scratch
- Coding in JavaScript → TypeScript
- Used YouTube API
- Devised frontend processing to keep up with voice generation

## Challenges / Efforts

- Constantly struggled with Chrome extension constraints
  - Very different from usual React writing style
  - Differences in handling popups and other elements
- Repeatedly refined and optimized algorithms when voice generation couldn't keep up with video playback
- Various approaches were needed such as getting YouTube subtitles, getting playback time, etc.
- Since YouTube officially announced that AI automatic dubbing would be implemented in 2024, I refined it to sell "cuteness"
- Challenges such as first TypeScript, using various APIs, using Recoil for state management
