## Overview

During an internship, I developed a matching service that connects foreigners who want to go on anime pilgrimage tours with anime fans in Japan who share common interests. While struggling with communication among members from different backgrounds, I pursued user value through code reviews on small PRs and MVP development. Won the Frontend Award.

Period: August 2023, 3 weeks

## What I Focused On / Efforts

- Since the main target was foreigners, I designed in Figma by referring to modern UI sites from overseas such as Pinterest and Dribbble
- Planned from the perspective of what needs which users have based on current trends
- Adopted GraphQL for efficient data retrieval
- Due to the short development period, pursued MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development
