    "content": "A first-year master's student majoring in Information Systems at Toyama Prefectural University.<br />During junior high and high school, I played Splatoon for 5000 hours. I was a self-proclaimed 'useless person' who slept during class and played games until morning after getting home.<br />Disgusted with myself, I decided to change.<br />I entered graduate school in 2025 and plan to study abroad for a year in 2026 to realize my dreams."
